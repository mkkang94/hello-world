Min's first-ever coding experience

Hi World!

I am Minkyung Kang, a 3rd-year PhD student majoring in neuroscience.
As I have set my long-term goal to become a professor whose lab has a wet-lab part AND a dry-lab part, I am trying to get myself familiar with bioinformatics.
EVERY SINGLE THING in "this" world that I am learning is so new to me, and right now, I've only got used to using "cd" and "ls" in Linux (haha).
I feel very positive about stepping into this new world and equipping myself with such new toolkits!
Fingers crossed to become a wonderful neuroscientist!!!
